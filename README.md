<p>This is a python notebook containing the task in which we had to download the table from a Wikipedia article and save it as a CSV file. I have added two extra columns which gives the Wikipedia link as well as the city municipal website.</p>
  <p>To obtain the table, just run all the cells of the notebook.</p>
